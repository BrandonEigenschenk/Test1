This excludes certain contracts held for trading purposes and is reported net rather than gross. Business-specific methodologies for net volumes have been applied to oil products, pipeline gas and power. Paper trades that do not result in physical product delivery are excluded. Retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under trademark licensing agreements are also excluded from the scope of Shell’s net carbon intensity metric.[B],Acquisitions and divestments are included in the actual performance tracking with the target and baseline year unchanged. Note that acquisitions and divestments could have a material impact on meeting the targets.[C],Percentage of delivered energy may not add up to 100% because of rounding.
